This project is just a REST endpoint to read a Twitter user's public timeline. I created it basically to extract
tweets so I can use them later to play around with them in https://github.com/franDayz/tweetcategory

In order to work an application.properties file must be created under src/main/resources, with the following properties:
spring.social.twitter.appId=???
spring.social.twitter.appSecret=???
